# IMITATION LEARNING IN UNITY
<b>This is a implementation of [Vectorized neural network](https://github.com/HectorPulido/Vectorized-multilayer-neural-network) </b>in unity, an open source project that uses neural networks and backpropagation in c# <br/>

## HOW IT WORKS
[![Banner](http://img.youtube.com/vi/HRYYxJd9qiA/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRYYxJd9qiA) <br/>
Artificial neural networks are a group of algorithm that can imitate almost any existing function, just like a universal stimator, it's a hierarchical matrix multiplication function that can imitate even a human behaviour.

With the human monitor script the keys that human presses and the sensors of the bot are keeped to be used as a dataset for the Neural net script and it's signals are interpreted by the brain to make a human - like behaviour 

## TO DO
- More examples

## WHY (MOTIVATION)
This tutorial was made for <b>Hector Pulido</b> for his youtube channel <br/>
https://www.youtube.com/c/HectorAndresPulidoPalmar <br/>
And his Twitch Channel<br/>
https://www.twitch.tv/hector_pulido_<br/>

## HOW TO USE
Open it on unity 2018 or greater (sorry about that >-< ), and play around with the project.

## EXAMPLES

### SELF DRIVING CAR
![Example](/Images/ExampleImage.gif) <br/>
At this moment there is only one example in the project, a self driving car with a lot of raycast as inputs and Horizontal and Vertical axis as output
